# Exploding Topics API Analysis

## Project Overview

This project uses the Exploding Topics API to retrieve and analyze trending keywords, identifying emerging topics with rapid growth. The primary aim is to explore how the trending data provided by Exploding Topics can be leveraged for SEO purposes in an online news context. By surfacing popular, high-growth keywords across various industries, news organizations can use this data to gauge breakout trends and optimize content strategies around topics that may gain significant traction.

While the project is oriented towards uncovering timely topics, it’s also focused on assessing the suitability of these keywords for SEO. We analyze whether the trending terms align with typical news readership interests and how this data might fit within a content strategy geared towards growing search-driven traffic.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Docker must be installed on your machine.

### Steps to Set Up

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store sensitive environment variables like your API key.
   - Example `.env` file content:
     ```
     API_KEY=your_exploding_topics_api_key
     ```
3. Build and run the Docker container using the following command:
   ```bash
   sh ./src/build_run.sh
   ```
   This command builds the Docker image and launches a Jupyter Notebook server, making it accessible at `http://localhost:8888`.

### Notebook Usage

Once the container is running, open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the /notebooks folder to explore and retrieve trending keywords from the Exploding Topics API. You can adjust query parameters such as category, timeframe, and sorting to tailor the data for specific analysis.

## Purpose of Keywords and SEO Application

The keywords and trends obtained from the Exploding Topics API provide insight into high-growth areas across broad markets, from tech startups to consumer products. For news organizations, leveraging these keywords can aid in identifying “breakout” trends early, giving them the potential to publish timely articles optimized for SEO around these terms. However, it's worth noting that while the API's focus on general industry trends can inform newsworthy topics, the keywords may not always align with the specific, long-tailed search phrases typical in news readership.

Using these trends for SEO purposes involves identifying keywords with strong growth trajectories that could be adapted for editorial coverage. Although this data does not cover all nuances of timely news events, it highlights potential broad-interest topics that could appeal to audiences in categories such as business, media, and technology.

## Understanding the Results

The Notebook displays the trending keywords, descriptions, and associated search volumes retrieved from the API. You can examine each keyword’s growth rate to see how interest is building over time. While this growth data provides a solid indicator of rising topics, it is important to supplement it with other tools that focus on real-time news events and long-tail search queries for a more complete SEO strategy.

## Key Takeaways

After testing the Exploding Topics API, it's evident that the keywords retrieved are generally optimized for identifying rapidly growing trends but may not align well with the needs of an online publishing news organization. While Exploding Topics does a good job surfacing popular emerging keywords, its focus is largely on broad market and industry shifts, such as products, startup trends, and technology categories, rather than the nuanced, topical, and long-tailed queries often sought by news outlets.

## Next Steps

Given the limitations in aligning Exploding Topics keywords with targeted, long-tail search needs, news organizations should consider supplementing this tool with alternatives like Ahrefs or Semrush that focus more on real-time, long-tail queries. Additionally, social media trend monitoring can provide timely insights into emerging topics relevant for news coverage, which may be quicker to appear on platforms like Twitter or Reddit before search engines. Combining these resources will provide a more robust, nuanced keyword strategy for news-driven content.
